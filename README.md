Supervised learning (SL) is a machine learning algorithm that uses labeled datasets to train models to predict outcomes or classify data. The term "supervised" refers to the presence of a "supervisor" or "teacher" who guides the learning process. Here I am trying to demonstrate my knowledge on these techniques.
